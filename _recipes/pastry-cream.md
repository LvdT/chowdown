To avoid a crust forming when the cream is stored, let some butter melt onto the surface before it cools down completely.
Flour can be replaced with a lower dose of starch (10 g). The amount of flour or starch can also be changed to have a different thickness.
It is possible to add vanilla, citrus, rosewater or another flavouring when heating up the milk.
